 * EE_Messages_Addressee
 *
 * This class is just for preparing an Addressee object used by the Messages subsystem of EE.  We take an incoming array of data and set it up in a formatted object that will be consistent among all message_types. That way each element will be present in every addressee object but just might not contain a value depending on the data received.
