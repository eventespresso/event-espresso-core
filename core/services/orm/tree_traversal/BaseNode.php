/**
 * Class BaseNode
 *
 * Represents a task to be done when traversing a model object tree to identify all the dependent model objects.
 * See the concrete classes for details, but the basic structure is you have a starter ModelObjNode that wraps the
 * model object whose dependent related objects you want to identify, it has a list of RelationNodes (one for each of
 * its model's relations); each of those builds a list of ModelObjNodes for each of the related model objects,
 * recursively.
 * Client code creates a ModelObjNode, provides  it with a model object, and repeatedly `visit()` on it until all of its
 * related model objects are identified.
 *
 * When traversing the tree of objects, the pseudo code is this:
 *
 * Start off with a model object, and a budget of how many model objects we want to discover
 * For each of its relations:
 *      count the number of related model objects
 *      then fetch some of them from the DB (no more than what's in our budget)
 *      record how many we fetched, and compare it to our budget
 *      if we're at the budget's limit, stop.
 *      otherwise, for each of them:
 *          start again with it being the root model object.
