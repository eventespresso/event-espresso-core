The following are tests for datepickers in EE.

Where there are start dates and end dates:

* [ ] Verify that when you click a start date, an acceptable default is setup.
* [ ] Verify that when you click out of a start date field, an acceptable default for the end date is set.
* [ ] Verify that if you manually empty either start date or end date field that no errors occur and that there will be a replacement date added based on the related field.  In other words, if you blank the start date field, when you change focus it should automatically be filled with a date based off of the end date field.


For all date fields

* [ ] Verify selecting the field triggers the datepicker to display.
* [ ] Verify that what is selected in the datepicker ends up being the value for the input.
* [ ] Verify that modifying the value in the input adjusts what is available in the datepicker.
