# Schema

This screen is intended to provide users with helpful tools to understand their WPGraphQL Schema.

Some ideas:

- browse the schema as "static" docs
- browse the schema visually (ex: GraphQL Voyager)
- see schema changes over time
  - track breaking changes
- understand what GraphQL types are connected to what WordPress types
  - ex: select a WordPress type, such as "post_type: Post", then see all the Types in the Schema generated from it (Post, RootQueryToPostConnection, CreatePost...etc)
