# Query Composer

The Query Composer allows user to compose queries using a form.

This is based on the "GraphiQL Explorer" work originally done by OneGraph (https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer),
but was rebuilt to be filterable to allow for third parties to customize the field inputs, etc.
