For example, all the organization shortcodes will use actual data you\'ve setup for your organization.  For global template previews, the previewer will obtain the first active event from your database and use data from it.  If you are previewing a custom event template then THAT event will be used for the preview.  The only data that is dummy data is typically data that would be entered by a person registering for an event', 'event_espresso'); ?></p>
