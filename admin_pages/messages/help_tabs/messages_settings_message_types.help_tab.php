To deactivate a Message Type, drag the message type box from the "active area" into the "inactive" area in the right sidebar. To re-activate, simply reverse your steps. Remember that when you deactivate a message type, if that message type has any settings, the settings will be lost. However, any message templates that match the messenger and message type you deactivated will be preserved, they are just marked "inactive" in the database.', 'event_espresso'); ?></p>
