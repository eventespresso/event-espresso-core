**Thanks for your pull request!**

Please answer the following questions in order to expedite its acceptance.

#### What problem does this work solve, or what benefit does it have?

#### Why do you think these changes are needed in Event Espresso core instead of being put in an add-on? 
> Additions to EE core should benefit 80% of its users, otherwise the work is probably best put in an add-on

#### Why do you think this is the best implementation?

#### Does this include unit tests? Or how can it be tested?
> Automated tests not only demonstrate the code works, but also help in ongoing maintenance. So pull requests with automated tests are preferred.
