## What Our Users Say

> Your plugin saved our client nearly $9000 in development costs because it handled the majority of the functionality we were looking for at a much lower cost. Event Espresso's staff have been very responsive to our needs when we have them (which has been rare, because the plugin is so well coded). Great job on a great plugin!

Brandon P. - [Experience Farm](http://www.experiencefarm.com/)

> At first we looked at CVENT for one of our clients and they wanted $16,000 per year for 3000 event attendees + fees totaling $22k. That is before Staff and Webinar fees. Worst of all we had to prepay the $16k amount even if we never used all 3000 attendees. That was when we looked at Event Espresso and we realized we could build our own event system for less than 16K. For the most part we have been very satisfied with our decision. The real ROI will come next year when they don't have to pay another 16k-22K! Over the next 5-6 years we should be able to claim that we saved the company over $100,000 - Thanks Event Espresso!

David Waterman - [KT Benefits & InkItDigital.com](http://ktbenefits.info/)

> I can't really estimate how much time or money I've saved by using EE because I've always used it! I would have to guess that without it, I would need someone full time to keep my events organized, so that's at least $10K. In 3 years I went from running up to 7 parties per weekend (Fri. night - Sun. night) to running up to 33 parties per weekend. My sales for 2014 were $540,000+. It boggles my mind sometimes. I don't know how I would possibly keep this all straight without my Event Espresso registration system which allows my guests to register and pay online, and keeps track of everything for me.

Tara Smith - [The Uncorked Artist](http://www.theuncorkedartist.com/)

> Thank you, we just did 2 sell out seminars of 50 attendees in 48 hours using Event Espresso and it was awesome. My wife was able to pick up on the processing backend with ease. You have done a great job on getting this system together - very simple, clear and well laid out With powerful functionality. I am so glad I dumped the old booking application we had and gave Event Espresso a go. Just wanted to say thanks, and thanks for the very patient, friendly and speedy assistance in helping me to get it all set up at the start. Many thanks to you and your team. A grateful customer.

Nicholas de Castella - [Emotional Intelligence Trainings](http://www.eq.net.au/)
> It is a very, very slick plugin. It's one of those plugins where you install it, change a couple of settings, and boom you're selling tickets.

Brad Williams - [WebDevStudios](http://webdevstudios.com/)

> Thanks to you and the rest of the team for Event Espresso -- Every time I get a signup for an event, I think about how much time EE saves me -- and signups happen while I'm out on the water teaching kayaking, not answering the phone.

Tue Brems Olesen [OnAdventure](http://onadventure.dk/)

> [Tri-South, Inc](http://tri-southinc.com/) is using Event Espresso to manage the course catalog, event ticketing, and class registration. [As their developer] I have customized a few items to make the site and plugin a seamless integration. The client is very pleased!

Jenifer - [Jenifer Design](http://jeniferdesign.com/)

> My hope with this whole integration is to be able to show other school districts an affordable and easy solution to these registrations. I cannot believe how much money they are charged for less by other companies. This has the potential to save schools tens of thousands, which is huge right now.

Kelly - [College Station Independent School District](http://csisd.org/)

> I chose EE because, a few years ago, I was using it on a personal website and loved it. So, when I discovered that our current event management system that is deployed in other areas of campus was completely deficient for this initiative's needs, I didn't even hesitate to use EE.
