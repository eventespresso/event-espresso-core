== Description ==

Manage your events from your WordPress dashboard. Reduce your admin, reduce your costs, make your life easier!

Event Espresso is a [WordPress event manager](http://eventespresso.com/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=plugin_description_tab&utm_content=WordPress+event+manager) which makes it easy for you to register attendees for classes, workshops, events, trainings, conferences or concerts, all from your WordPress website. Event Espresso events are created from the WordPress admin area. You can create signup forms to collect information about your attendees, accept payments, and create reports. The lite version of the plugin provides everything that you need to manage your event using WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can I fully manage my events with Event Espresso Lite?**

You will be able to fully manage basic events with Event Espresso Lite. This will be sufficient for many WordPress users. If you need advanced features you can check out our Premium [Event Management plugin](http://eventespresso.com/pricing/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_content=Event+Management+plugin&utm_campaign=plugin_faq_tab)

**Do you monitor the WordPress.org support forums?**

We do, although you'll find a faster response time at the [support forums on our website](http://eventespresso.com/support/forums/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_content=support+forums+on+our+website&utm_campaign=plugin_faq_tab).

**How do I display a single event on my page?**

To display a single event on a page use the [SINGLEEVENT single_event_id="Unique Event ID"]

**How do I display a list of events in the sidebar?**

To display a list of events in the sidebar, use the Event Registration Widget. If your theme doesn't use widgets, you can use  '<?php display_all_events(); ?>' in your theme's code.

**I have no idea how to get started. Can you help?**

You need to create a new page and insert only the [ESPRESSO_EVENTS] shortcode. This page should be excluded from your navigation. This means you should not add it to your navigation menu under Appearance > Menus. If you're using a pre-WordPress 3.0 theme you can use the [exclude pages plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exclude-pages/).

You should also create and exclude from navigation:

* insert [ESPRESSO_PAYMENTS] shortcode on a new page to create a URL back to the payment/thank you page
* insert the [ESPRESSO_TXN] to create the page for processing your payment transactions


**Can I display a list of attendees?**

To display list of attendees of an active event use [LISTATTENDEES] on a page or post.

**How do I customize my confirmation emails?**
For customized confirmation emails, the following tags can be placed in the email form and they will pull data from the database to include in the email.

[fname], [lname], [phone], [event],[description], [cost], [company], [co_add1], [co_add2], [co_city],[co_state], [co_zip],[contact], [payment_url], [start_date], [start_time], [end_date], [end_time]

= Sample Mail Send =
