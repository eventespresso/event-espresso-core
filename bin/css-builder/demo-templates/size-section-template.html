    <p class="section-intro">
        Having text that meets WCAG requirements does not just mean using contrasting colors, as there is
        also an interaction with the size of the font. Smaller fonts require colors that have a higher contrast
        compared to the background color they are placed on. Although not a technical requirement, line-height and
        spacing can also affect readability, especially with smaller font sizes.

    <p class="section-intro">
        To make it as easy as possible to maintain accessibility as well as a harmonious design aesthetic, we have
        combined several CSS properties together using the semantically relevant "focus-priority" class name. The
        "focus-priority" classes range in value from <code>.ee-focus-priority-1</code> to
        <code>.ee-focus-priority-9</code> and represent the visual hierarchy that you wish to impart on your
        application. Elements with a higher "focus-priority" are ones that a user should see and read first and
        therefore use larger font sizes, but can get away with using lower contrast colors. Elements with a
        lower "focus-priority" are ones that a user should see or read after other elements and utilize smaller font
        sizes, but higher contrast colors to remain accessible. This of course is subjective and these styles can be
        applied solely to adjust appearance as desired.

    <p class="section-intro">
        Each theme can specify a <code>marginDefault</code> property which gets applied to a set of default margin
        sizes to dynamically generate a total of 9 margin sizes. If themes require more control, they can also define
        all of the <code>marginSizeModifiers</code> separately. The results are the following CSS variables:
