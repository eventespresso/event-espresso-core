# EE Coding Standards and Best Practices

Here at Event Espresso, we ascribe to a certain set of coding standards and guidelines for all our code.  The documents in this folder outline these standards.  If you want to contribute to the Event Espresso codebase, please familiarize yourself with these standards.

## Why Have Coding Standards?

Coding standards help avoid common coding errors, improve the readability of code, and simplify modification. They ensure that files within the project are consistent and organized.

We established coding standards because code isn’t only supposed to do things, but it’s also supposed to be beautiful.  We believe ugly code often leads to ugly behaviour.
