# Creating a Payment Method

## Payment Method Properties to Set

To create your own Payment Method, you create a class which extends `EE_PMT_Base` (found in core/libraries/payment_methods).

In the constructor you should declare the value of the following properties:

| Property Name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
`_requires_https` |  Boolean describing whether or not this payment method should only be used on a server that supports HTTPS.
`_gateway` | The EE_Gateway class which handles communicating with the payment processing site, or NULL
`_pretty_name` | Should be an i18n string that will be name of the payment method type as shown to users
`_default_description` | The default description of how customers use the payment method.
`_default_button_url` | The URL of the image which will be the default button image
`_has_billing_form` | Introduced in 4.8. Payment methods with an onsite gateway class set this to TRUE by default, and payment methods with an offsite gateway class or no gateway class set this to FALSE by default. Use this if you need to override the default.

## Abstract Methods to Implement

You must implement the two following methods:

### `generate_new_settings_form`

This method creates a new `EE_Payment_Method_Form` form ([click here to read more about EE4 forms](../J--EE4-Forms-System/ee-forms-system-overview.md)), which also takes an extra constructor argument called "extra_meta_inputs" which is just an array of form inputs for any extra data you need for your payment method to work (eg, Paypal ID, or any other settings you want to store). This is the form that will appear to the site admin when updating the payment method's settings. Eg:

![Payment Method Admin Interface](../images/payment-method-admin-interface.png)

The inputs with a green square surrounding them are part of the `EE_Payment_Method_Form`, whereas the ones with an orange square surrounding them are from the "extra_meta_inputs". When the form is saved, the `EE_Payment_Method_Form` takes care of saving each "extra_meta_input" in the esp_extra_meta table and associating it with the payment method.

That was generated by the `EE_Bank::generate_new_settings_form()` method:

```php
/**
 * Gets the form for all the settings related to this payment method type
 * @return EE_Payment_Method_Form
 */
public function generate_new_settings_form() {
    return new EE_Payment_Method_Form(array(
        'extra_meta_inputs'=>array(
            'page_title'=>new EE_Text_Input(array(
                'html_label_text'=>  sprintf(__("Title %s", "event_espresso"),  $this->get_help_tab_link()),
                'default'=>  __("Electronic Funds Transfers", 'event_espresso')
            )),
            'payment_instructions'=>new EE_Text_Area_Input(array(
                'html_label_text'=>  sprintf(__("Payment Instructions %s", "event_espresso"),  $this->get_help_tab_link()),
                'html_help_text' => __( 'Provide instructions on how registrants can send the bank draft payment. Eg, mention your account name, bank account number, bank name, bank routing code, and bank address, etc.', 'event_espresso' ),
                'default'=>  __('Please initiate an electronic payment using the following bank information: <br/> Account Owner: Luke Skywalker <br/>Bank Account # 1234567890 <br/>Bank Name: Rebellion Bank <br/>Routing Number: 12345 <br/>Bank Address: 12345 Wookie Rd., Planet Corellian. <br/>  Payment must be received within 48 hours of event date.', 'event_espresso')
            )),
        ),
        'exclude'=>array('PMD_debug_mode')
    ));
}
```

### `generate_new_billing_form`

This method also needs to be implemented to define the billing form for payment method that will appear to customers when they use this payment method. If you don't need a billing form for your payment method (eg, EE_PMT_Bank and EE_PMT_Paypal_Standard don't) then this method can just return NULL. But otherwise it should return an `EE_Billing_Info_Form` (a flexible form that just has a reference to the payment method it represents) or `EE_Billing_Attendee_Info_Form` (a child of `EE_Billing_Info_Form` but includes standard address fields like Firstname, Email, and Address, etc.). Here is the Paypal Pro billing form

![Payment Form Example Frontend](payment-form-example-frontend.png)

And this is the method that generates most of that code:

```php
public function generate_new_billing_form( EE_Transaction $transaction = NULL ) {
    $allowed_types = $this->_pm_instance->get_extra_meta( 'credit_card_types', TRUE, array() );
    $billing_form = new EE_Billing_Attendee_Info_Form(
        $this->_pm_instance,
        array(
            'name'=> 'Paypal_Pro_Billing_Form',
            'subsections'=>array(
                'credit_card'=>new EE_Credit_Card_Input(
                    array( 'required'=>TRUE, 'html_class' => 'ee-billing-qstn', 'html_label_text' => __( 'Card Number', 'event_espresso' ))
                ),
                'credit_card_type'=>new EE_Select_Input(
                    //the options are set dynamically
                    array_intersect_key( EE_PMT_Paypal_Pro::card_types_supported(), array_flip( $allowed_types )),
                    array( 'required'=>TRUE, 'html_class' => 'ee-billing-qstn', 'html_label_text' => __( 'Card Type', 'event_espresso' ))
                ),
                'exp_month'=>new EE_Month_Input(
                    TRUE, array( 'required'=>TRUE, 'html_class' => 'ee-billing-qstn' )
                ),
                'exp_year'=>new EE_Credit_Card_Year_Input(
                    array( 'required'=>TRUE, 'html_class' => 'ee-billing-qstn'  )
                ),
                'cvv'=>new EE_CVV_Input(
                    array( 'required'=>TRUE, 'html_class' => 'ee-billing-qstn' )
                ),
            )
        )
    );
    return $this->apply_billing_form_debug_settings( $billing_form );
}
```

This generates a `EE_Billing_Attendee_Info_Form` and adds some credit card-related inputs (specifically, we require a valid credit card number, a credit card type, valid expiration date, and a valid CVV). The line `$this->apply_billing_form_debug_settings()` just takes care of autofilling some of the fields while the payment method is in debug mode, just for convenience while testing.

If you'd like to learn more about how to customize this form (eg, adding other inputs, changing client-side and server-side validation, or change its display) please [read our EE4 Form Documentation](../J--EE4-Forms-System/ee-forms-system-overview.md).
