# EE4 REST API: Editing Relations
Event Espresso 4 data is highly inter-related (see [Relations: Discovering Them, What Relations Establish](ee4-rest-api-writing-data.md#relations-discovering-them-what-relations-establish).)

In order to modify how data is related, you are free to directly edit each entity's foreign keys (eg `EVT_ID` on datetimes is a foreign key, indicating which event the registration belongs to) and entries in their join resource (eg the resource `question_group_question` is actually a resource between questions and question groups).
However, as of 4.9.74, the EE4 REST API also provides helper endpoints for adding and removing relations.

For each read-only route for fetching related items (eg `events/123/datetimes`) there is a corresponding write-only 
route (eg `events/123/datetimes/456`) for adding or removing relations. These relations-editing routes are the same
except they accept another ID, the ID of the related entity.

These endpoints are listed in the index (see [Event Espresso Data in the WP API Index](ee4-rest-api-introduction.md#event-espresso-data-in-the-wp-api-index).)

## Adding Relations

To associate data, send a `POST` request.

Eg, if there was an event with ID 124, and a datetime with ID 1 which weren't previously related,
```
POST https://demoee.org/wp-json/ee/v4.8.36/events/124/datetimes/1
``` 
will set datetime's `EVT_ID` to be 123, thus relating the data.
On success, the JSON response will look like this

```json
{
    "datetime": {
        "DTT_ID": 1,
        "EVT_ID": 124,
        "DTT_name": "",
        "DTT_description": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "DTT_EVT_start": "2018-09-06T08:00:00",
        "DTT_EVT_end": "2018-09-06T17:00:00",
        "DTT_reg_limit": null,
        "DTT_sold": 2,
        "DTT_reserved": 0,
        "DTT_is_primary": false,
        "DTT_order": 1,
        "DTT_parent": 0,
        "DTT_deleted": false,
        "DTT_EVT_start_gmt": "2018-09-06T15:00:00",
        "DTT_EVT_end_gmt": "2018-09-07T00:00:00",
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "event": {
        "EVT_ID": 124,
        "EVT_name": "Stormtrooper Party",
        "EVT_desc": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "EVT_slug": "ee",
        "EVT_created": "2018-08-07T09:50:28",
        "EVT_short_desc": "",
        "EVT_modified": "2018-08-07T09:50:28",
        "EVT_wp_user": 1,
        "parent": 0,
        "EVT_order": 0,
        "status": {
            "raw": "publish",
            "pretty": "Published"
        },
        "comment_status": "open",
        "ping_status": "closed",
        "EVT_display_desc": false,
        "EVT_display_ticket_selector": true,
        "EVT_visible_on": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_additional_limit": 10,
        "EVT_default_registration_status": {
            "raw": "RPP",
            "pretty": "PENDING_PAYMENT"
        },
        "EVT_member_only": false,
        "EVT_phone": "",
        "EVT_allow_overflow": false,
        "EVT_timezone_string": "",
        "EVT_external_URL": "",
        "EVT_donations": false,
        "EVT_created_gmt": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_modified_gmt": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_visible_on_gmt": "2018-08-07T23:50:28",
        "link": "http://laragonee.test/events/ee/",
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    }
}
```

Notice that it returns an object with both `event` and `datetime` properties, which are the two complete up-to-date entities.

An error response would look something like this:

```json
{
    "code": "rest_datetime_invalid_id",
    "message": "Invalid datetime ID.",
    "data": {
        "status": 404
    }
}
```
specifically, there will be a key called `code`, showing the error's code, and `message`, which is meant to be more 
human-readable.

### Editing Relations Across Join Resources

When editing a relation that uses a join resource (ie, is listed as a `HABTM_Relation` relation on the 
[resources endpoint](https://github.com/eventespresso/event-espresso-core/blob/master/docs/C--REST-API/ee4-rest-api-introduction.md#resources-models))
there will also be an entry titled `join`, which is an object with a property whose name is the joining entity's name, and its value is the joining entity.

Eg, if you have a question 12 and question group 4,
```
POST https://demoee.org/wp-json/ee/v4.8.36/questions/12/question_groups/4
```
will make them related (ie, make question 12 part of question group 4, by adding a new entry in the join resource `question_group_question`), and will return

```json
{
    "question": {
        "QST_ID": 12,
        "QST_display_text": {
            "raw": "Is test",
            "rendered": "<p>Is test</p>\n"
        },
        "QST_admin_label": "is-test",
        "QST_system": "",
        "QST_type": {
            "raw": "RADIO_BTN",
            "pretty": "Radio Buttons"
        },
        "QST_required": false,
        "QST_required_text": "",
        "QST_order": 12,
        "QST_admin_only": false,
        "QST_max": null,
        "QST_wp_user": 1,
        "QST_deleted": false,
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "question_group": {
        "QSG_ID": 4,
        "QSG_name": "IS",
        "QSG_identifier": "is-5bbb8fa565cf72.42203209",
        "QSG_desc": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "QSG_order": 4,
        "QSG_show_group_name": true,
        "QSG_show_group_desc": false,
        "QSG_wp_user": 1,
        "QSG_system": 0,
        "QSG_deleted": false,
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "join": {
        "question_group_question": {
            "QGQ_ID": 16,
            "QSG_ID": 4,
            "QST_ID": 12,
            "QGQ_order": 0,
            "_links": {
                ...
            },
            "_calculated_fields": {}
        }
    }
}
```
This means `join.questino_group_question` is a entity that joins the other two items together.

If there were a previous entry in the joining resource, it would instead be updated.

#### Providing extra parameters across Join Resources

You might remember that sometimes there's extra data stored in these "Join Resources". For example, on the relation between Questions and Question Groups, there's an order property named "QGQ_order". You can set these by adding them to the request's BODY, just like you would inserting any new data. For example, you would do

```
POST https://demoee.org/wp-json/ee/v4.8.36/questions/12/question_groups/4
```
and in the request's "form-data" body, you could pass either
```
QGQ_order=123
```
(normal request body)
or as JSON
```
{"QGQ_order":123}
```
Important: do NOT pass these extra parameters in the URL querystring. They will be ignored.
## Removing Relations

You use the same routes to remove relations, just using a different HTTP method, `DELETE`.

Eg, if there was an event with ID 124, and a datetime with ID 1 which weren't previously related,
```
DELETE https://demoee.org/wp-json/ee/v4.8.36/events/124/datetimes/1
``` 
will set the datetime's `EVT_ID` to 0, thus removing it from the event.

The JSON response will look like this

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "datetime": {
        "DTT_ID": 1,
        "EVT_ID": 0,
        "DTT_name": "",
        "DTT_description": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "DTT_EVT_start": "2018-09-06T08:00:00",
        "DTT_EVT_end": "2018-09-06T17:00:00",
        "DTT_reg_limit": null,
        "DTT_sold": 2,
        "DTT_reserved": 0,
        "DTT_is_primary": false,
        "DTT_order": 1,
        "DTT_parent": 0,
        "DTT_deleted": false,
        "DTT_EVT_start_gmt": "2018-09-06T15:00:00",
        "DTT_EVT_end_gmt": "2018-09-07T00:00:00",
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "event": {
        "EVT_ID": 124,
        "EVT_name": "Stormtrooper Party",
        "EVT_desc": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "EVT_slug": "ee",
        "EVT_created": "2018-08-07T09:50:28",
        "EVT_short_desc": "",
        "EVT_modified": "2018-08-07T09:50:28",
        "EVT_wp_user": 1,
        "parent": 0,
        "EVT_order": 0,
        "status": {
            "raw": "publish",
            "pretty": "Published"
        },
        "comment_status": "open",
        "ping_status": "closed",
        "EVT_display_desc": false,
        "EVT_display_ticket_selector": true,
        "EVT_visible_on": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_additional_limit": 10,
        "EVT_default_registration_status": {
            "raw": "RPP",
            "pretty": "PENDING_PAYMENT"
        },
        "EVT_member_only": false,
        "EVT_phone": "",
        "EVT_allow_overflow": false,
        "EVT_timezone_string": "",
        "EVT_external_URL": "",
        "EVT_donations": false,
        "EVT_created_gmt": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_modified_gmt": "2018-08-07T16:50:28",
        "EVT_visible_on_gmt": "2018-08-07T23:50:28",
        "link": "http://laragonee.test/events/ee/",
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    }
}
```

on successful removal of the relation. Notice that the datetime's `EVT_ID` is now 0.

### Removing Relations Across Joining Resources

Requests to remove relations across joining resources will also have a `join` property in the response. This is the
joining entity before it was removed during the request.

Eg, if you have question 12 and question group 4, 
```
DELETE https://demoee.org/wp-json/ee/v4.8.36/questions/12/question_groups/4
```
will remove the entry in `question_group_questions` which related that question to that group, and will return:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "question": {
        "QST_ID": 12,
        "QST_display_text": {
            "raw": "Where are you taking those droids?",
            "rendered": "<p>Where are you taking those droids?</p>\n"
        },
        "QST_admin_label": "droids",
        "QST_system": "",
        "QST_type": {
            "raw": "RADIO_BTN",
            "pretty": "Radio Buttons"
        },
        "QST_required": false,
        "QST_required_text": "",
        "QST_order": 12,
        "QST_admin_only": false,
        "QST_max": null,
        "QST_wp_user": 1,
        "QST_deleted": false,
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "question_group": {
        "QSG_ID": 4,
        "QSG_name": "Tatooine Admission Questionnaire",
        "QSG_identifier": "is-5bbb8fa565cf72.42203209",
        "QSG_desc": {
            "raw": "",
            "rendered": ""
        },
        "QSG_order": 4,
        "QSG_show_group_name": true,
        "QSG_show_group_desc": false,
        "QSG_wp_user": 1,
        "QSG_system": 0,
        "QSG_deleted": false,
        "_links": {
            ...
        },
        "_calculated_fields": {}
    },
    "join": {
        "question_group_question": {
            "QGQ_ID": 15,
            "QSG_ID": 4,
            "QST_ID": 12,
            "QGQ_order": 0,
            "_links": {
                ...
            },
            "_calculated_fields": {}
        }
    }
}
```

to indicate the relation was successfully removed. In this case, the entry in `join.question_group_question` is actually the
**previous** question-group-question entry that was removed during this request.
If no question-group-questions were removed during the request, `join.question_group_question` will be null.
If the property `success` is `true`, it means there is no relation between the two items at the end of the request;
`false` indicates there is still a relation between them (although, currently if this were the case, an error message should
have been returned).
