Components are various react components and supporting code that is exposed for usage in Event Espresso core and extensions.  Some components have a dependency
on various WordPress components but in most cases this does not mean they are restricted to use only in the editor.

| Component Type | Description |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| [Query](query/README.md)  | These are components that are used for various query attributes (where "query" typically means arguments included on a REST request).
| [General UI](ui/README.md) |  These are components that are more generic in nature.
| [Form](form/README.md) | These are components that are related to form/import ui.
