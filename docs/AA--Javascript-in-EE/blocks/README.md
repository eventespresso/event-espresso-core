Blocks are registered elements for the new WordPress editor (codename Gutenberg). Blocks have a dependency on the Gutenberg editor and thus are not usable outside the context of the editor (or WordPress content created via the editor).

## Current developed blocks:

Block | Description |
| --------- | ---------- |
`EventAttendees` | Block controlling the display of a list of attendees to an event (or specific datetime/ticket for an event).
